# The Report Viewer App

## Overview

The account manager of a fictional client company needs to view reports on how employees are making phone calls and using mobile data. The candidate must provide a user interface to the API to allow the account manager to view:
- Available reports.
- Available data for each report for the specified billing period.

## UI Design

Feel free to come up with your own, but please notice code quality and technical aspects are way more relevant than design.

## API Responses

API responses can be found in the `/api` directory.
- `/api/reports.json` contains a list of available reports.
- `/api/reports/{reportId}-{billingPeriod}.json` contains data for the report id `reportId` over the billing period `billingPeriod`.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Report list
- I want to see a list of available reports.
- I want to be able to sort the report list by name and description.
- For each report, I want to see:
    - The report's name,
    - The report's description,
    - A button to navigate to the report results.
- I want to be able to specify over which billing period a report is run.

### Report view
- I want to see results of the selected report.
- I want the results of the report to be formatted in a usable manner.
- I want to be able to sort the results by each column.
- The table's columns are defined in the report data JSON.
- If the API response is not found, malformed or incomplete, I want to be informed accordingly.

Consider best practices, usability and error handling matters.

## Deliverables
- A link to a github/similar repository, a zipped git repository with source code **or** any other deliverable you prefer.
- Instructions on how to build and run it in a web browser, preferably in the form of README.md.
